## Quotas

ZooKeeper has both namespace and bytes quotas. You can use the ZooKeeperMain class to setup quotas. ZooKeeper prints *WARN* messages if users exceed the quota assigned to them. The messages are printed in the log of the ZooKeeper.

Notice: What the `namespace` quota means is the count quota which limits the number of children under the path(included itself).

```text
$ bin/zkCli.sh -server host:port**

```

The above command gives you a command line option of using quotas.



### Setting Quotas

- You can use `setquota` to set a quota on a ZooKeeper node. It has an option of setting quota with `-n` (for namespace/count) and `-b` (for bytes/data length).

- The ZooKeeper quota is stored in ZooKeeper itself in **/zookeeper/quota**. To disable other people from changing the quotas, users can set the ACL for **/zookeeper/quota** ,so that only admins are able to read and write to it.

- If the quota doesn't exist in the specified path,create the quota, otherwise update the quota.

- The Scope of the quota users set is all the nodes under the path specified (included itself).

- In order to simplify the calculation of quota in the current directory/hierarchy structure, a complete tree path(from root to leaf node) can be set only one quota. In the situation when setting a quota in a path which its parent or child node already has a quota. `setquota` will reject and tell the specified parent or child path, users can adjust allocations of quotas(delete/move-up/move-down the quota) according to specific circumstances.

- Combined with the Chroot, the quota will have a better isolation effectiveness between different applications.For example:```bashChroot is:192.168.0.1:2181,192.168.0.2:2181,192.168.0.3:2181/apps/app1 setquota -n 100000 /apps/app1 ```

- Users cannot set the quota on the path under **/zookeeper/quota**



### Listing Quotas

You can use *listquota* to list a quota on a ZooKeeper node.



### Deleting Quotas

You can use *delquota* to delete quota on a ZooKeeper node.
